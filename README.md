### Usage
`python typewriter.py <name of poem text file>`

- Installed ImageMagick from homebrew
- Tried running sample command `convert -background lightblue -fill blue -font Zapfino -pointsize 72 label:Anthony label.gif`. Command can be found at https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/text/
- Failed because I don't have Zapfino font installed on my system. For that matter I have no font installed on my system.
- Check installed fonts by running `convert -list font`
- Populate 'em fonts for Mac by following this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24696433/why-font-list-is-empty-for-imagemagick
- Run command again.
- You should have label.gif.
